Description: This package enables fast estimations by variational Bayesian 
    methods for various diagnostic classification models (DCMs). DCMs are a class of discrete latent variable models
    for classifying respondents into latent classes that typically represent distinct combinations of skills they possess. 
    Recently, to meet the growing need of large-scale diagnostic measurement in the field of educational, psychological, and psychiatric measurements,
    variational Bayesian inference has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. To facilitate their applications, 
    the R package variationalDCM is developed to provide a collection of recently-proposed variational Bayesian estimation methods for various DCMs.
