# Introduction

`variationalDCM` performs recently developed **variational Bayesian estimation** methods for Diagnostic Classification Models (DCMs). This package enables **fast** estimations by variational Bayesian methods for various DCMs and can be applied to **large-scale** data.

# DCMs

DCMs are a class of discrete latent variable models used to reveal students' current learning status on (latent) **attributes**. Attributes are skills required to answer items correctly, and DCMs reveal whether each test taker masters each attribute. Usual DCMs' entries are item response data matrix that contains only 0 (wrong answer) and 1 (right answer) and binary matrix called Q-matrix that represents how the J Items depend on the K latent attributes.

DCMs have a lot of sub-models and we introduce some models related to this package.

## DINA model
The deterministic input noisy AND gate (DINA) model is one of the most popular DCMs and one of the non-compensatory models, which assume test takers must have mastered all the required latent attributes associated with a particular item in order to respond correctly to that item. 

## DINO model
The deterministic input noisy OR gate (DINO) model is another popular model. The DINO model is one of the non-compensatory models, which assume test takers must have mastered all the required latent attributes associated with a particular item in order to respond correctly to that item. 

## saturated DCM
The saturated DCM is the generalized model that includes many DCMs such as DINA and DINO model as the special case. 
So, saturated DCM can be used when relationships among attributes are unknown.

## multiple choices DINA model
The multiple choices DINA (MC-DINA) model is the generalization of usual DINA model. MC-DINA model assumes the item response data contains polytomous values, in that, test items have multiple options. MC-DINA model , and assumes attributes on each multiple choice option.

## hidden Markov DCM
The hidden Markov DCM (HMDCM) is a tool for a longitudinal item response data.
